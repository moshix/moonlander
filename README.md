# MoonLander / 370

A lunar lander implementation for any web server out there. All you need is a webserver and a browser... or an IBM mainframe with 1977-era MVS 3.8...   

This moon lander can autoland itself (most of the times anyway...)!!

However, given the excellent animation capabilities of Javascript, this game is an homage to the tradition of Lunar Landng gaming, especially for something as vintage as MVS 3.8.
