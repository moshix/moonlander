# MoonLander / 370

A lunar lander implementation for any web server out there. All you need is a webserver and a browser... or an IBM mainframe with 1977-era MVS 3.8...   

This moon lander can autoland itself if it is within the physical envelope of engine thrust and physics. Code has been copied and adapted from the Apollo guidance computer Luminary code [here](https://github.com/virtualagc/virtualagc/blob/master/Luminary099/LAMBERT_AIMPOINT_GUIDANCE.agc)


However, given the excellent animation capabilities of Javascript, this game is an homage to the tradition of Lunar Landng gaming, especially for something as vintage as MVS 3.8.
